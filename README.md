# Basic REST API App

This is a basic REST API application written in Python.

Used tools:

- Poetry
- FastAPI
- SQLite

## How to run project

```cmd
poetry shell
uvicorn basic_rest_api_app.main:app --reload
```

After starting the server, you can access the application on <http://127.0.0.1:8000> or <http://localhost:8000>.

If you make any changes to the application, the server should reload automatically (because you included the `--reload` option to the `uvicorn` command above).
